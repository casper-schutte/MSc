Notes from Prof:
    - Make a scoring scheme. For each read, see by how many bp it overhangs the reference.
        (incorrect assignment). Derive a "map quality" score for each read in this way.
        Think about the maths and come up with a coefficient or mapping score
        for the alignment of the read to the reference.


    - Think about choosing examiners (thinking about internal examiners).

    - Think about testing different alignment algorithms with the bash script



08/04/2022:
    - Cleaning up the git repo.
    - Moving away from testing the algorithm 100s of times with the bash script, will now try to clean up the
        outputs and take the data further by adding a scoring system.
