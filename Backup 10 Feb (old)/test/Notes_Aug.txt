Have spent time familiarising myself with BW transform and FM indexing
Have read through the code sent by Prof Patterton (CIGAR string manipulation)
Will integrate this code into my own, such that CIGAR strings and quality scores can be called by the program.

Made rearrangements to the original lambda_virus file. Replaced 2 lines (140 characters) with repeating "A" around line
290 - 300. Will map reads from the original to the altered lambda_virus_reA.fa


13/08/21:
    - First thing I want to do is integrate the code from Prof with my own.
    - I want to be able to return the read and position of mismatches. First need to be able to call
        CIGAR strings from the SAM file. This will mean making changes to the script.
    - Testing this today


25/08/21:
    - Have been sick but spent a lot of time thinking about the problem.
        I would like my alignment to not even return the reads that match to save memory space and time
        but this might not be a concern as it might still be fast enough. If it takes 3 minutes instead
        of 2, this might be acceptable. Keep this in mind if the problem becomes more computationally
        intensive.

    - Use list comprehension whenever you use lists in for-loops. Can greatly increase efficiency this way.


30/08/21:
    TEST results (more rigorous test to come):
    - I made a number of rearrangements in the genome and mapped non-rearranged reads using the current testing
        protocol (default settings, 150bp reads, 50 bp overlap on either side). Generated a SAM file (eg1.sam)
        and changed Prof's code to return only read names and mapping quality for reads that mapped under the
        maximum quality observed in the SAM file. The test was successful, all 13 reads that did not have a
        mapping quality of 42 were returned along with the read name. Importantly, not ALL the reads that were
        rearranged were returned BUT the other reads (which mapped accurately) can be identified by the position
        they mapped to, since they break the sequence; they map to a far away position, instead of
        [read_length - overlap] bp away.

        e.g. of output: [['r34', 0], ['r41', 8], ['r42', 0], ['r265', 8], ['r266', 0], ['r393', 40], ['r394', 0],
         ['r395', 0], ['r396', 0], ['r397', 0], ['r398', 0], ['r399', 0], ['r486', 1]]


    - Need to perform another experiment where I keep track of the rearrangements, and see if they are all returned.
    - Return the position of the read as well.
    - For the lowest mapping qualities, return them and perform a local alignment to distinguish where the borders
        actually are.
        
        
31/08/21: Experiment 3
	- Using lamba phage genome included with Bowtie2 as an example.
	- Details recorded in "experiment_3.txt" (rearrangements made, Bowtie2 settings, results, etc)
	- Will introduce 2 large rearrangements and one smaller one. 
	- Will include results here.
