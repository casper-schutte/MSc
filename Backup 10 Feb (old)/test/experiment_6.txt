Experiment 6:
Experiment to test the adapted algorithm on rearrangements across multiple chromosomes.

How does the script return multiple chromosomes:
A new field is now returned as well, showing the chromosome name (or whatever is after ">" in the FastA file).
This is needed because the positions are reset with each chromosome, so simply getting position 129 does not
give enough information to say where the read is mapping from.

Format: position, chromosome name, read name/number, MAPQ score
[(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
[(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
[(1, 'Chr3', 'r295', '44'), (8391, 'Chr3', 'r380', '44')]
[(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]
These continuous blocks represent the chromosomes, without any rearrangements having taken place.

Experiment 6.1: Translocations
    - From start of chrom to start of another:
        Result:
        [(1611, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r132', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r133', '44'), (1501, 'Chr1', 'r148', '25')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr3', 'r295', '44'), (8391, 'Chr3', 'r380', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]

        At first glance it looks like we won't be able to tell the difference between this rearrangement and
        one that moves the start of Chr1 to the end of Chr1.
        However, this is NOT the case. We can see that in the MAPQ field for the first border:
                    [(1611, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r132', '44')] <----- This one
and this one -----> [(1, 'Chr1', 'r133', '44'), (1501, 'Chr1', 'r148', '25')]

        Normally at least one (if not both) of these edges should have a MAPQ below the maximum. We can see that
        this is not the case here; both border reads show perfect mapping quality which indicates the start of a new
        chromosome. This method might prove tricky, keep this in mind.


    - Reciprocal of previous:
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r1', '44'), (1501, 'Chr2', 'r16', '25')]
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r17', '44'), (12941, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
        [(1611, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (15951, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr3', 'r295', '44'), (8391, 'Chr3', 'r380', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]

        Comparing this to the last one, we can see that the start of chromosome was moved to the start of chromosome 2.

    - Middle of chrom to middle of another:
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (5601, 'Chr1', 'r57', '44')]              <----- Can see where the original seq was
        [(7884, 'Chr1', 'r58', '25'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r126', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r127', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r272', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr3', 'r273', '44'), (2901, 'Chr3', 'r302', '25')]
        [(5741, 'Chr1', 'r303', '44'), (7731, 'Chr1', 'r323', '44')]        <----- Can see where it was moved to
        [(3011, 'Chr3', 'r324', '18'), (8391, 'Chr3', 'r380', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]

        As with the translocation experiments in Experiment 5, the borders are clearly identified. No reciprocal map
        required for this example.

Experiment 6.2: INDELs
    - Deletion from start of chrom
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(1541, 'Chr3', 'r295', '44'), (8391, 'Chr3', 'r364', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r365', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r472', '44')]

        Border identified, even with no mismatching reads.

    - Reciprocal mapping (insertion)
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(0, '*', 'r295', '0'), (0, '*', 'r309', '0')]
        [(1, 'Chr3', 'r310', '41'), (6851, 'Chr3', 'r380', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]

        Clear to see that an indel happened from the block of sequence that did not map anywhere,
        and by the shorter length of chr3, we can see that a deletion happened at the start of chr3.

    - Since the middle insertion does not change the ends of the chromosomes, we do not need to retest
        this. The previous experiment showed that we can identify INDELs at the start, we do not need
        to continue testing INDELs.

Experiment 6.3: Inversion/reversal
    - Inversion at start of chrom:
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(0, '*', 'r295', '0'), (0, '*', 'r318', '0')]
        [(2450, 'Chr3', 'r319', '36'), (8391, 'Chr3', 'r380', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]

    -Reciprocal mapping:
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(0, '*', 'r295', '0'), (0, '*', 'r318', '0')]
        [(2450, 'Chr3', 'r319', '36'), (8391, 'Chr3', 'r380', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]

        The borders for these are exactly the same. There is a sequence (or block) in both genomes of the same size
        that does not map anywhere in either alignment. This indicates an inversion event. The start position on
        the consecutive block that is chr3 starts at position 2450, instead of position 1. This indicates that the
        rearrangement happened at the start of chr3. The low (relatively) MAPQ of read r319 indicates this is where the
        border of rearrangement is.

    - Inversion at end of chrom:
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr3', 'r295', '44'), (6091, 'Chr3', 'r357', '24')]
        [(0, '*', 'r358', '0'), (0, '*', 'r380', '0')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]

    - Reciprocal mapping:
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr3', 'r295', '44'), (6091, 'Chr3', 'r357', '24')]
        [(0, '*', 'r358', '0'), (0, '*', 'r380', '0')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]

        Again, the borders are identical. Same reason as in the previous inversion. We can see that
        the rearrangement happened at the end of chr3 and that the border is in read r357 (by looking at the MAPQ).


Experiment 6.4: Duplication
    - Duplication at start of chr:
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr3', 'r295', '44'), (8391, 'Chr3', 'r380', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '44'), (501, 'Chr4', 'r386', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r387', '38'), (10623, 'Chr4', 'r496', '44')]

        Border clearly identified by the low map quality and repeating positions in chr4. How do we know that
         the start of chr4 was not duplicated to the end of chr3 instead of the start of chr4 like we suspect?
         The scores show no possibility of a mismatch at the end of chr3. The only read with less than perfect
         score in this case is where chr4 starts "again". Indicating a duplication took place.

    - Reciprocal mapping:
        Result:
        [(1, 'Chr1', 'r1', '44'), (14551, 'Chr1', 'r148', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr2', 'r149', '44'), (14341, 'Chr2', 'r294', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr3', 'r295', '44'), (8391, 'Chr3', 'r380', '44')]
        [(1, 'Chr4', 'r381', '1'), (301, 'Chr4', 'r384', '1')]
        [(1031, 'Chr4', 'r385', '1'), (11253, 'Chr4', 'r488', '44')]

        The borders are clearly identified. However, it is not clear what is happening with the second to
        last block, the reads are mapping to the right place, but with much lower MAPQ. Nevertheless, the previous
        alignment made it clear that a duplication took place.
