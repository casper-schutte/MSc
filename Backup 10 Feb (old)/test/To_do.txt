07/07/21:
    - Update experiment flow diagram
    - Make a very general/reusable script to make reads:
        - Variable length
        - Variable overlap
        - Variable to keep track of original position
        - Variable to associate a read with quality score
        - Way to write to a file (format?)



17/07/21:
    - Making script that makes reads as above
    - Checking if they are correct (visually)
    - Will Bowtie2 take this input?
    - Add randomized quality scores, does it map back to the genome as it should?
    - make rearrangement, how does it map now?

19/07/21:
    - The script creates a fastQ file with a randomized quality score
    - Bowtie2 accepts the file to map to a genome
    - Now introduce large rearrangement/s and observe what Bowtie2 does
    - It should successfully map the unchanged sections, and SAMtools pileup will be
        used to investigate the parts that aren't mapping where they "should."


23/07/21:
    - Will make a new flow diagram to describe my idea (and room for improvements)
    - Investigate SAMtools and BCFtools for commands that my idea easier.
    - Test extracting CIGAR strings and the read positions where the CIGAR string
        indicates that a read did not map properly.
