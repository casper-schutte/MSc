I will be changing the way the reads are made in order to increase the coverage (number of times a
base at a specific position appears in a read). This might increase the ability to pinpoint the
rearrangement to a single base pair.

This will probably change a lot of things about the code, but I will keep the current version of
the files and scripts as they are.
