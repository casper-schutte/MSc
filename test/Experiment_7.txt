Experiment 7:
Experiment to test the algorithm on real data

Tested with the e. coli strains k12 and bl21.
The results are far too messy to make meaningful conclusions from them. The algorithm seems too sensitive.
I will try to increase the coverage of the alignment (how many times a single base pair appears in reads).

This will change the way that the script works, because using the array of the differences in position won't work.
But with more reads of varying length starting from the same position, we should no longer need to test the
continuity of the reads. Multiple reads should confirm the presence of a breakpoint and where it maps to, as the
reads continue to progress through the sequence.

This new method will be described in the "Notes_Nov.txt" file
