    New idea:
        For each random starting position in the "make_reads_fa.py" script, make multiple reads of varying length.
        e.g. 100 bp, and 200 bp. or 100, 150, and 200. Save them in a way such that they can be called and compared
        after alignment. This might reveal a lot of information about the hard to interpret rearrangements such as
        duplications.


Have the taken the last few days off. Was sick for a bit and needed a mental holiday. I will be working every
    day until this is done.

7/12/21:
    - I will be testing the new idea today. Initially, I want to see what the results look like if I simply make
        two reads for each random starting position, the reads will have different lengths. I will try 100 bp and
        200 bp. Duplications seem to be the biggest problem, so I will continue using the rearranged genome from
        the previous few experiments. For future experiments, remember that it is vital to include duplications.

    - Trying to find literature on how duplications are found using bioinformatics tools. One suggestion I came across
        was to let Bowtie2 report multiple alignments, thus showing multiple positions where reads map very well,
        which would indicate a potential duplication. I don't think this will work for my purposes, because it will
        create a lot of noise in the results. Bowtie2 would also return many badly mapping positions.
        However, given that my script groups breakpoints by position, this might work. Will keep this in mind and try
        it.

Experiment:
    - Made reads from "exp7_5.fa" (the rearranged genome I had been using in the last experiments). For each random
        starting position 2 reads are made, one of length 100 and the other of length 200. The reads are combined into
        the same read list so coverage is calculated from the combination of both or the read lengths.
        Made reads from the original multichromosomal test genome (lambda phage) in the same manner.

This experiment yielded more "hits" on the borders compared to the equivalent experiment that used 20x coverage and
    200bp read length (exp8_4).

The problem in this experiment is that there is still no reliable way to ascertain that the borders at position 1
(chr 4) are not representative of a real border. The problem is that the border is either assigned to one position or
the other. Remember, a duplication was made from position 1 to the end of the same chromosome. I need a way to track
the pairs of reads (one of the pair with length 100bp and the other with length 200, or whatever lengths I end up
deciding on).

There are 2 ideas I want to try:
    1) Allow Bowtie2 to return more than one alignment per read. Yes, this will obviously create a lot of "noise" in
        my data in the form of useless alignments. However, most of this noise will not fall into the positional
        groups that I construct. As I have observed in my experiments so far, the actual difference in border position
        reported is close to nothing. We could make the allowance 10bp and get the same results as above. These
        alternative alignments could support the identification of duplications. I can check if the same read maps
        well to multiple border areas.

    2) The other idea is one I have discussed previously: Tracking the read pairs and checking if they map to
        different areas. There is a property of the reads that might allow this; the reads start with r1 which is
        100bp and r2 follows from the SAME POSITION with length 200bp. So the reads can be paired up such that every
        even numbered read of 200bp has an odd numbered read of length 100bp preceding it.

I will try to first idea first. I will keep the other parameters the same and simply perform an alignment but return
the 2 best alignments for each read.

This is just the borders at pos 701. The MAPQs are hard to interpret. In the reporting mode I set Bowtie2 to (-k),
    MAPQs work differently in this mode. 255 indicates that this is the best position to map the read to.
    This method alone does not give me real quality scores I cannot work with these results alone. An interesting
    observation I made was that it is common for reads to align to BOTH sides of the border.
    I need to add a function in the script that returns reads that appear more than once in the final output.
    This output can be used in conjunction with the previous one in order to obtain more information about what is
    happening at the borders.


9/12/21:
    - Today I will write a function that returns reads that appeared more than once in the output file for the previous
    experiment. In this way, borders can be connected such that we might be able to deduce where the rearrangement
    originated.
    - Investigated writing a bash script to run the command line arguments for the alignments with the tools I use.
        e.g. Bowtie2 indexing, aligning with local mode, aligning with local mode and k-reporting mode, sorting the
        alignments with SamTools. Having such a script would increase my efficiency and help me to package the tool
        once it is done. Read through some guides about bash scripting.

10/12/21:
    - Will continue writing and testing the function that groups duplicate reads (reads that appear more than once in
        the SAM file in the k-reporting mode).
    - Will continue writing the bash script to make my life easier.

    Grouping duplicates:
        - Instead of reporting all the connected borders and their associated attributes, I can simply report the
            number of times two borders were reported to be connected.
