    - Have 2 weeks to finish all the coding so that I have 6 weeks to write up.

    - To do:
        1) Fix the code, it cannot handle the positions resetting for different chromosomes.

        2) Test the algorithm/tool on real data

        Sounds easy, but I have not been able to do either.

    - I can't start testing on real data because the algorithm might change. So the priority is fixing the code.
        The problem is that when the consecutive blocks are calculated, they are not associated with the read
        name or number. In the previous iteration of the script, position (relative to the reference) was unique.
        Now, with the introduction of multiple chromosomes, the positions are no longer unique. Thus, I need to change
        the way the consecutive blocks are located or find a way to keep additional data such that the blocks are still
        identifiable.

    - One way I can overcome the problem is by using a different algorithm to return nonconsecutive blocks. I like the
        algorithm. The other way is to try to keep track of the read name while using the same algorithm. I will try
        the latter first.
