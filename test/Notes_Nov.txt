    - Have 2 weeks to finish all the coding so that I have 6 weeks to write up.

    - To do:
        1) Fix the code, it cannot handle the positions resetting for different chromosomes.

        2) Test the algorithm/tool on real data

        Sounds easy, but I have not been able to do either.

    - I can't start testing on real data because the algorithm might change. So the priority is fixing the code.
        The problem is that when the consecutive blocks are calculated, they are not associated with the read
        name or number. In the previous iteration of the script, position (relative to the reference) was unique.
        Now, with the introduction of multiple chromosomes, the positions are no longer unique. Thus, I need to change
        the way the consecutive blocks are located or find a way to keep additional data such that the blocks are still
        identifiable.

    - One way I can overcome the problem is by using a different algorithm to return nonconsecutive blocks. I like the
        algorithm. The other way is to try to keep track of the read name while using the same algorithm. I will try
        the latter first.

    - Made a lot of progress today. The script "consecutive_block_test.py" is working well using the new method.
        There are one or two kinks that might have to be worked out but I will integrate it into my code and test
        different rearrangements. Then I will test using real data.
    - One thing I need to do is figure out how to extract the "AS" field as this will likely help me to assign borders
        more than just using the mapping quality (MAPQ). Since for FastA files there are reads that were clipped
        but still had a perfect mapping score (uniqueness).

03/11/21:
    - Will conduct some tests today to verify how the adapted algorithm works with different kinds of rearrangements.
        The results will be written up in "experiment_5.txt."
    - First round of tests were successful. Will continue tomorrow.

04/11/21:
    - Will continue with the tests of the new script. As soon as that is done I can start testing real data.

05/11/21:
    - Continued with testing the script on artificial rearrangements. See "experiment_5.txt"

06/11/21:
    - Should be finishing experiments on artificial data. Might make changes on what and how things are returned.

07/11/21:
    - Needed to make small changes. Results very good so far (see experiment_5.txt)
    - Testing multichromosoma data, see experiment_6.txt
