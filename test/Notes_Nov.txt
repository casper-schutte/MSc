01/11/21:
    - Have 2 weeks to finish all the coding so that I have 6 weeks to write up.

    - To do:
        1) Fix the code, it cannot handle the positions resetting for different chromosomes.

        2) Test the algorithm/tool on real data

        Sounds easy, but I have not been able to do either.

    - I can't start testing on real data because the algorithm might change. So the priority is fixing the code.
        The problem is that when the consecutive blocks are calculated, they are not associated with the read
        name or number. In the previous iteration of the script, position (relative to the reference) was unique.
        Now, with the introduction of multiple chromosomes, the positions are no longer unique. Thus, I need to change
        the way the consecutive blocks are located or find a way to keep additional data such that the blocks are still
        identifiable.

    - One way I can overcome the problem is by using a different algorithm to return nonconsecutive blocks. I like the
        algorithm. The other way is to try to keep track of the read name while using the same algorithm. I will try
        the latter first.

02/11/21:
    - Made a lot of progress today. The script "consecutive_block_test.py" is working well using the new method.
        There are one or two kinks that might have to be worked out, but I will integrate it into my code and test
        different rearrangements. Then I will test using real data.
    - One thing I need to do is figure out how to extract the "AS" field as this will likely help me to assign borders
        more than just using the mapping quality (MAPQ). Since for FastA files there are reads that were clipped
        but still had a perfect mapping score (uniqueness).

03/11/21:
    - Will conduct some tests today to verify how the adapted algorithm works with different kinds of rearrangements.
        The results will be written up in "experiment_5.txt."
    - First round of tests were successful. Will continue tomorrow.

04/11/21:
    - Will continue with the tests of the new script. As soon as that is done I can start testing real data.

05/11/21:
    - Continued with testing the script on artificial rearrangements. See "experiment_5.txt"

06/11/21:
    - Should be finishing experiments on artificial data. Might make changes on what and how things are returned.

07/11/21:
    - Needed to make small changes. Results very good so far (see experiment_5.txt)
    - Testing multichromosoma data, see experiment_6.txt

08/11/21:
    - Finished experiment 6, see experiment_6.txt for results.
    - Ecerything is working as it should.

09/11/21:
    - Need to incorporate the new algorithm with the full script, so that we can also look at reads that did
        not map properly. These reads should correlate with the borders of rearrangements.

10/11/21:
    - Trying to fix the way that the algorithm deals with duplications. One of the duplicated pair of reads "maps" to
        the right place but the other either does not or does map but in both cases the MAPQ is 1. I would like to
        combine these reads with terrible quality scores into a single block (if they are continuous). This would
        make the output much more clear.
    - Decided it would be better if the borders and blocks were written to a .txt file instead of only being printed
        in the terminal.

13/11/21:
    - Will be trying to change the way reads are generated
    - Changing the way Bowtie2 returns reads such that coverage is increased. Multiple reads will be constructed from
        the same start position but of different lengths.
    - Did not find a way to do this in Bowtie2, but Samtools can do it:

    $ Samtools view -q (MAPQ below which reads are not returned) file_name.sam  > file_name.filtered.sam

    - After filtering out the reads with very low MAPQ (1 or 0, which were the ones that did not map or were
        duplicated), the real data proved too "noisy." My algorithm was too sensitive. Mapping single, slightly
        overlapping reads to construct continuous blocks worked very well for the artificial data. However, the real
        data proved much too noisy. Small differences in the genomes (and in the way reads happen to be mapped -
        remember that Bowtie2 uses random seeds to start looking for alignments).

    - I need to change the way reads are constructed. Multiple reads (of varying lengths) will be constructed from the
        same starting position. This way, the reads will all map where the genomes are the same. Where there is a
        breakpoint, the shorter reads should map but the longer ones map less and less well. This way, small
        differences will not be falsely returned as breakpoints. Instead, the longer (and further along) reads will
        start mapping again, confirming the small change or single badly mapped read is not a breakpoint.

    - We can make the reads overlap more, keeping the current method of construction and return, but I think that
        a more accurate method would use reads of a variable length.

    - Kept the read length at 150 bp, but made the overlap 140. Tested on the e. coli strains bl21 and k12. The
        result is a massive SAM file (188 MB !). Visually, this file is hard to go through but borders of what seem
        to be rearrangements are clear. The positional change is only 10bp, so it is very clear where subsequent reads
        do not map as well as the previous ones. It is also very clear where reads begin to map again. Small
        differences in the genome that are (likely) not rearrangement breakpoints are clearly identified as well
        since the reads quickly begin mapping properly again.

    - Pay attention to the bitwise flags (2nd column) in the SAM file as well. With this new alignment, I noticed
        some valuable information in this field that was not apparent in my small tests.

    - Need to find a "sweet spot" for read length and overlap. Consistent read positions might not matter as much
        now, so perhaps we can use variable length. We will see how further tests go.


14/11/21:
    - Will be testing the heavily overlapping reads on artificial data. I kept the files I tested the older algorithm
        on, but I would like to test on genomes that have multiple rearrangements and some other small differences,
        such that I do not fall into the same over-sensitivity.

    - After visually confirming that this method will work, I need to decide how my script will decide where borders
        are. I can look at consecutive reads and keep track of how they map. When the end of a read crosses a
        rearrangement, it will (should) have a lower MAPQ score than the previous read. It will also show some
        soft-clipping in the CIGAR string (e.g. 135M15S - 135 matching base pairs and 15 soft-clipped ones). These
        properties together should allow the script to pinpoint rearrangement breakpoints.

    - Spent most of the day driving back to stellenbosch.

15/11/21:
    - Will test the algorithm on artificial data again today. Will make multiple rearrangements and use the new method
        for creating overlapping reads. See "Experiment_7.txt" for more details.

17/11/21:
    - Needed to change the algorithm to return reads around (preceding and following) breakpoints (areas with low
        mapq that need to be investigated).

    - Have really been struggling with the code these past few days. What I want the program to do:
        Iterate over every read, start "counting" when the program encounters a read that does not map 100% correctly.
        Then, the program will keep track of how these reads map (position, MAPQ score, CIGAR string).

18/11/21:
    - Had a meeting with Prof who had a few helpful suggestions. We need to greatly increase the coverage. The reads
        will now be constructed from random starting positions until the total length of all the reads is equal to
        the coverage multiplied by the length of the original genome. This will increase the amount of times a
        nucleotide occurs in the reads. We will then look for places where mismatches start appearing from one side
        and assign a border to the last mapping read. This border will be backed up by other reads that contain it.

    - Have successfully changed the script "find_borders_test.py" such that it returns just the part of the cigar
        string that contains the number of matches

    - Have used the result above to write a function that returns the original positions of the breakpoints themselves.
        The result of the aforementioned deletion and mapping are shown below:

    - Can clearly see that multiple reads confirm the positions of breakpoints. Where there is disagreement, I can
        choose to trust the breakpoint that came from the read with the highest MAPQ or perhaps take the mode.
        This is to be determined.


19/11/21:
    - Will test the new method on different rearrangements. This method is different to the previous ones in that
        continuity does not matter because the reads are generated from random starting positions. This means that
        any rearrangement should be treated the same.

    In both cases, the first border (the border where the deletion took place) is exactly the same. The second border
    has a different position because one genome contains sequences that the other does not, due to deletions.
    Of course, what is an insertion and what is a deletion is simply a matter of perspective.

    It should not matter what kind of rearrangements are made, since we are only looking at reads that do not map.
    The exception to this is duplication which will now be tested.

    Single duplication:

Chr2 	 	 5546 	 	 r2105 	 	 42 	 15S85M

    Again, we see borders clearly identified. Duplications are a little bit more tricky. This information (the
    position and MAPQ score) are enough to tell where the borders are. Perhaps not to a single base pair in ALL cases,
    but it is clear that the higher the MAPQ score, the closer the positions of the breakpoints become.

    I think an algorithm that uses the MAPQs as weights could be used to narrow down on the breakpoint.

Chr2 	 	 6345 	 	 r2745 	 	 9 	     44S56M

    In this experiment, the only reads that were returned were the borders of the duplication. In the sorted SAM file
    there are reads in between these that all have a mapping quality of 1. It might be useful look at these reads
    as well because they would indicate the position the duplication originated from. Nevertheless, the script
    identified all of the borders, and only the borders. Real data is much more noisy. This means that I need a
    function that looks at how many times a potential border is contained in a read. A foreseeable problem is that
    the reads do not report the exact same position for the border. So, how to filter out the noise reads and keep the
    actual ones is my next problem.

    Idea: Go through the reads, give each returned potential breakpoint a weight (probably based on MAPQ). The lower
    the MAPQ, the more allowance on either side.

    Read length and coverage need to be optimised. This could be left up to the user but it would be good to have a
    default that would work in common use.


20/11/21:
    - Thinking about how to group the borders. Given that the read length is 100, we definitely do not want to use
        a read that maps the border more than 100 positions away.

23/11/21:
    - There are two strategies I am considering
        1) Extend the border area around the breakpoint proportionately to how LOW the MAPQ is. This follows from the
            observation that the lower the MAPQ, the further the border is assigned from the actual border. In other
            words, if a border is assigned at 1105, with MAPQ of 44, the border will be extended by 1 bp on both sides
            (or one side, look at the data). if another border is assigned at 1120, with a low MAPQ (10), we can
            extend that 1120 on both sides by some number of base pairs.
            We then look at the borders with the highest confidence and "back them up" by finding this position
            in the extended borders of the borders with lower confidence.

        2) The other strategy is to create an array of all the borders and then use Numpy.average(). This function
            returns the average of the values in an array. When a second array is used in the argument, it is used
            as a weight for each value. This would decrease the affect that borders with low confidence have
            on the outcome.


        A combination of these two strategies might work. I would get the borders that map in roughly the same area.
        Take the border with the highest confidence as a starting point, then check if other borders fall in the same
        region (allowing more extension for borders with bad MAPQ). I could then collect these and use these to get
        the average (weighted). This will only really work if the "bad" borders are mapped to both sides. If they
        are disproportionately to one side then this will pull the average away from the actual border.

24/11/21:
    - I have created a function in "find_borders_test.py" that separates the most confident breakpoints from
        each other by looking at the positions. There is an allowance variable that allows the positions to differ
        on either side by some integer. The high confidence borders are lists within lists. Borders that map very
        well and are within (allowance) base pairs are in the same list.

        I need to write another function or extend the current one in order to add the less confident breakpoints
        to the lists.

    - Done. Extended the function such that the borders that have lower mapq score are appended to the list containing
        the higher mapq border, if they are within some distance (allowance variable). We can use the borders within
        reads that had a MAPQ lower than the maximum to add confidence

26/11/21:
    - Result of algorithm:

Chr2 	 	 6345 	 	 r2745 	 	 9 	     44S56M

The borders with the highest confidence are extracted from the rest and then grouped by position. Then, the remaining
borders are compared with the high confidence borders. If they are within an allowable distance from a high confidence
border, they are added to the list.

    - It is time to test on a different file with rearrangements in different places.
        The multichromosomal test genome "lv_mc.fa" will be rearranged to include a deletion and a translocation.
        The new file will be named "exp7_3.fa" and reads will be constructed from it and mapped reciprocally to the
        original lv_mc.fa file. I will keep track of the positions of the breakpoints to evaluate the accuracy.

    - (I still need to think of a way to report the total confidence.)

    - Rearrangements: Deletion of 140 bp at position 1330 (up to position 1470) on chromosome 1.

    - Translocation (150bp) from position 700 on chromosome 3 to end of chromosome 4

Discussion:
    - I noticed something VERY IMPORTANT. I have overlooked an important detail. I noticed that for the reads that
        start mapping and then stop (have M - for match before S - for soft-clipped) the correct positions are
        returned for the breakpoints. In the other case where reads start with soft-clipped bases the positions are
        off. This is because when a base is marked as soft-clipped, the position is NOT changed. This means that
        I should not be adjusting the position of the reads in this case. I will change the script and check the
        results.

    - Changed script to NO LONGER adjust the position of the breakpoints that start out as soft-clipped.

    Discussion: Holy shit... it works.
    I have verified that the positions returned are NOT simply a bug or error that returns the same value. These
    positions are derived from the SAM file. These results are fantastic. There are so many reads that support the
    reads that map with high confidence.


27/11/21:
    - Will perform the same kind of test again. Again using the same test genome but with different rearrangements.
    Experiment 7.5:
    Rearrangements:
    - Reversal
        420bp from position 1 on chromosome 2, to position 420. 421 should be first mapping base in chromosome 2.

    - Deletion
        210 bp deleted from position 700 to 910 on chromosome 1. Should see borders at 700 and at 911

    - Duplication
        280 bp from position 1 on chromosome 4 were duplicated to the end of chromosome 4.

The border for the deletion is correct. Need to check why it is off by 1 base. This could be a case of a base
being replaced with the same base that used to be there. The other rearrangement and borders are  not clear from this
result, but the reciprocal mapping should reveal them. The first border from the reversal is not shown, as there are
no reads that map before position 421 on chromosome 2.

Firstly, I need to go through the list of reads that are left over at the end and try to group them as well. There
are no high confidence reads confirming the breakpoint at 10773 on chromosome 4, but with 4 adjusted reads pointing
to the same place I think it should be included.

The other deletion border is clear at position 911 on chromosome 1, exactly where it was predicted (made, rather).

The reads that were part of the duplication are not immediately obvious. I need to spend some time trying to
understand the return.


30/11/21:
    - Spoke to Prof and showed my results in the meeting today. Advice:
        Do not use the term "adjusted position", instead refer to these as breakpoints or rearrangement borders.
        I can use this laptop until the end of January.
        There is a lot of work to be done.
        Run more tests and figure out if there is way to make the duplications "look better"?

    - Experiment 8:
        - First, I will use the same two genomes from the previous experiment, but I will adjust the coverage and read
            length, independently.

    Experiment 8_1:
        - Same genomes but will make reads of length 200.

    - This result is interesting because even though there seem to be less "hits" on any given border, the output
        contains ALL the borders. In the previous experiment, neither output contained all of the borders.

    - Increasing the coverage drastically increased the number of hits on the borders.
        The border of the duplication is now contained in multiple high confidence reads.
