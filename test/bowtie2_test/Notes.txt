Notes on Bowtie2:
At this time the aim is to investigate the feasibility of
using Bowtie2 to map reads of one genome onto another and
vice versa. I am currently reading the documentation in
the bowtie2 manual and there are many aspects to consider
and keep in mind.

Different modes of reporting alignments.
Default mode (search for multiple alignments and report
the best one) will be used initially. My initial experiment
will simply introduce a few large rearrangements to a small
example genome and investigate whether bowtie2 and SAMtools
will be sufficient to identify rearrangements (and their
breakpoints). If ambiguity becomes a problem, consider
a different reporting mode.
In alternative reporting modes, the user can choose to have
all valid alignments returned (-a mode) or specify an upper
threshold for returned alignments (-k mode). Perhaps reporting lower-scoring
alignments would be helpful for finding specific kinds of rearrangements.
Update: After initial testing with default mode, I will also test using
the other modes.

Randomness:
There is randomness in the way bowtie2 chooses alignments.
When there are equally-good choices for where a read can map,
it uses a pseudo-randomly generated number to choose of them.
The seed for the RNG changes for each read BUT the seed can
set with "--seed" such that the same seed is used, making
alignments a reproducible action.
An important consideration is whether the bowtie2 python wrapper will
allow me the same level of control over the parameters.
