Experiment 3 part 2:
	Aim: Test calling reads that do not map well due to rearrangements in the genome
	
	Will be using the lambda phage genome included with Bowtie2 and introduce rearrangements.
	Bowtie2 will be used to map generated reads from the unchanged genome onto the one 
	with rearrangements, and vice versa.
	
	One large rearrangement will be made and the python script will be adjusted to 
	attempt to identify the mismatching reads. The reads that do not match will be 
	returned and a local alignment will be performed.

	Rearrangement:
	12 lines (59 to 70) were moved to line 100. Total 840 bp
	
	
    Reads will be constructed from the rearranged genome with the python script and
    mapped onto the unchanged genome. This process will be repeated reciprocally.
